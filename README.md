# Online vs. Classroom: Which Enrollment Type is Right?
## 9 September 2023 (Last Updated: 26 September 2023)

## Background and Objective
You are working as a data scientist at a local University. The university started offering online courses to reach a wider range of students. The university wants you to help them understand enrollment trends. They would like you to identify what contributes to higher enrollment. In particular, whether the course type (online or classroom) is a factor.

## Executive Summary
To determine whether course type is a factor in enrollment, we analyze the enrollment counts and test our hypotheses. Furthermore, we provide a machine learning model to predict enrollment counts of future offered courses by the university. The report is divided into the following sections:
1. Introduction: Overview of enrollment trends in universities offering both online and onsite courses.
2. Data Preprocessing: Detailed explanation on data cleaning.
3. Hypothesis Testing: Test to determine whether difference in enrollment counts is significant.
4. Regression Model: Model to predict future enrollment trends.
5. Conclusion: Final remarks obtained from the model experiments.
